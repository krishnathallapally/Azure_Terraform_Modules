### Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------
* We can create and run virtual machines (VMs) in the cloud using Microsoft Azureâ€™s Azure Virtual Machine service without having to manage the  infrastructure. We might set up the required OS in the virtual machine, like Linux, Windows, or Mac.
* Here I am creating a  complete Linux environment and supporting resources with Terraform. Those resources include a virtual network, subnet, public IP address, and more.

In this Section, you learn about a Terraform script that creates an Resource Group, Virtual Network,Security Group,Network Interface,Ssh Keys and Linux Virtual Machine.

#### Implement the Terraform code
------------------------------------------------------------------
* Here I have Created a files for every resource i have used to keep the better understanding.In main.tf file given configurations of linux vrtual machine.
* For creating linux virtual machine main.tf file, use help of official docs [Refer here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/linux_virtual_machine)
* For creating resource_group.tf file, use help of official docs [Refer here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/resource_group)
* For creating virtual_network.tf file, use help of official docs [Refer here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/virtual_network)
* For Creating Security_group.tf file, use help of official docs [Refer here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/network_security_group)
     * In securit_group.tf file for creating security rules, use help of official docs [Refer here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/network_security_rule)
* For Creating Public_ip.tf file, use help of official docs [Refer here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/public_ip)     
* For Creating network_interface.tf file, use help of official docs [Refer here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/network_interface)
    * In network_interface.tf file  for network interface security group association, use help of official docs [Refer here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/network_interface_security_group_association)
* For ssh_key.tf file, use help of official docs [Refer here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/ssh_public_key)
     * In ssh_key.tf file for tls private key use help of official doc [Refer here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tls/latest/docs/resources/private_key)
* Input variables let you customize aspects of Terraform modules without altering the module's own source code.
* Create a file named variable.tf and configure according to your files.
* Create output.tf file to see your Infra Id's or Any thing after applying the terraform code.

#### Resource Types Used:

 ```
## Module 
------------------------------------------------------------------

* Modules are the key ingredient to writing reusable, maintainable, and testable Terraform code.
* A Terraform module is very simple: any set of Terraform configuration files in a folder is a module.
* Syntax for using a module
```
module "< NAME >" {
    source = "< SOURCE >"

    [CONFIG ...]
}
```

* ***NAME***  is an identifier you can use throughout the Terraform code to refer to this module.
* ***SOURCE*** is the path where the module code can be found.
* ***CONFIG*** consists of arguments that are specific to that module.


### Azure Linux Virtual Machine(UBUNTU) Module

* Terraform Module to create Azure Virtual Network.

* Type of resources are supported:

  * ["azurerm_resource_group"](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/resource_group)
  * ["azurerm_virtual_network"](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/virtual_network)
  * ["azurerm_subnet" "az_vm_subnet"](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/subnet)
  * ["azurerm_network_security_group"](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/network_security_group)
  * ["azurerm_network_security_rule"](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/network_security_rule)

### Module Usage 

```
module "Virtual_Network" {
  source = "..//.." # Here You can give path to your vnet files located

  # Give your Configurations details from root module which  bascially are from  variables section of their respective resources
}

```
* This module by default creates a linux virtual machine with all basic given configueations.You can configure names and data according to your needs if you want to.

* After writing the code lets implement following steps

#### Terraform Usage

##### Initialize Terraform

* The terraform init command initializes a working directory containing Terraform configuration files.

```
terraform init
```
##### Validate Terraform

* The terraform validate command validates the configuration files in a directory.Validate runs checks that verify whether a configuration is syntactically valid and internally consistent, regardless of any provided variables or existing state.

```
terraform validate
```

##### Possibility of Error Occurences


 #### Meta-argument 

 ****count**** : I have used this meta argument in various files for creating multiple scenarios.

     * count is a meta-argument defined by the Terraform language. It can be used with modules and with every resource type.
     * The basic syntax referring to instances would be something like this
       ![alt text](images/1.png)
     * Use this with proper syntax otherwise chances of getting errors are high.

* In variable section for securtiy group rules i have used type is " list(objective({string})) " .

* While giving default values Priority should be distinct value for each otherwise it throws an error.

* You can ignore local file and also execute the code so the ssh key will generate into the path where you have initialized terraform.

* The key which generated is giving bad permission error when trying to connect to virtual machine.
* So change Permissions of key give only read access permissions to user.
* Here I have changed it manually with following steps 
   ![alt text](images/2.png)
   ![alt text](images/3.png)

* In network_interface.tf file ensure you create a life cycle and give `create before destroy ` = `true`. It is just to make sure when you are destoying the network interface also gets deleted, otherwise you get an error while destroying bad error
  ![alt text](images/4.png)

* In main.tf file
    * Give details of `size` syntax correctly otherwise it throws an error, the specified size is not part of it.
    * In source image reference give details of it correctly i.e., make sure it synatax is correct of it

##### Terraform execution plan

* The terraform plan command creates an execution plan, which lets you preview the changes that Terraform plans to make to your infrastructure.

```
terraform plan -out main.tfplan
```
##### Apply a Terraform execution plan

* The terraform apply command executes the actions proposed in a Terraform plan

```
terraform apply main.tfplan
```

* Verify the results 

##### Terraform Destroy

* The terraform destroy command terminates resources managed by your Terraform project.
* After Completion Of your Project or needs, if you want to terminate resources created use terraform destroy.
```
terraform destroy 
    or 
terraform destroy -auto-approve  
```
